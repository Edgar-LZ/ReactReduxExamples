# Modern React with Redux examples
This repository contains React projects created to practice important concepts of the library. The projects in the repository are part of the Modern React with Redux course, created by Stephen Grider.
In each folder, you will find only the relevant files for the concepts covered in the example. To make use of them, you will need to create your own react project and change the necessary files.

You can find the course at:
