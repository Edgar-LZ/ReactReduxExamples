# Requirements
This example uses the semantic-ui CSS framework.
If you want to replicate this example you need to go *cdnjs.com/libraries/semantic-ui*, search for the semantic.min.css link and add it to your *public/index.html* file as a stylesheet. 

We also use *axios* to fetch data from the *Youtube Data API v3*. To install it you can use the command
```
npm install --save axios
```
The flag ```--save``` tells npm that we want to save the package to the local project and creates an entry inside the *package.json* file.

As metioned we make use of the *Youtube Data API v3*. You can find the credentials for this API at ```https://console.developers.google.com```.
