# Important Concepts

### What is React?
React is a Javascript library that allows us to show HTML content to the user and handle user interaction.
React can work with a great variety of js libraries, packages, servers and databases.

React is split into two different libraries:

**React** knows what a component is and how to manage interactions between components.

**ReactDOM** makes components show up in the DOM.

**React components** are javascript classes or functions that produce HTML and describes how that HTML content handles user interaction.

### JSX

It is a js dialect that determines the content of our React app and tells a component how it should look like when it is rendered in the browser. Its sintax resembles to that of HTML but it is not HTML.

* The sintax for styling in JSX has some differences with that in HTML. 

* Adding a class to an element has a different sintax.

* JSX can reference  JS variables. 

### Event handlers

Event handlers are used to detect user interaction with the app and respond to it.

### Creating a React app
To create a React app you need to install Node.js in your computer, once you have node installed you can create a React project using:
```
npx create-react-app <name of project>
```
To start the app, use the next command in the project's directory:
```
npm start
```
